        <p>Today is St. Patrick's day, which means there's a lot of this online:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lá Féile Pádraig shona duit</p>
</blockquote>
<p>or this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lá Fhéile Phádraig sona duit</p>
</blockquote>
<p>or basically any variation of:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lá F(h)éile P(h)ádraig s(h)ona duit</p>
</blockquote>
<p>which <em>all</em> roughly mean 'Happy St. Patrick's Day' in Irish, but some of which are grammatically incorrect. (<strong>Note</strong>: I'm not going to get into pronunciation here, but for the curious, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pop2ivFUOw8">here's a video</a>.)</p>
<p>When I was learning Irish in school this was generally the trouble. The meaning is clear most of the time, but where or when to put the séimhiú (lenition - those 'h's above), the urú (eclipsis), or the additional 'i's (slendering) was never particularly clear. I got through Irish on the <em>vague feeling</em> about what was correct, mostly based off the sound of the thing<a href="#1">[1]</a>. </p>
<p>On some recent trip home to Dublin I bought a book on Irish grammar in some optimistic hope of fixing the situation. Inside this book must be contained a set of concise and logical rules, the mastery of which will enable me to unambiguously resolve problems like the above. <em>(hahahaha)</em></p>
<p>Let's break the phrase down. Translated literally (<em>and with caveats</em>)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>lá fhéile Pádraig -&gt; the feast day of Patrick<br>
X shona duit -&gt; happy X to you</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The second one is a bit easier so we can get that out of the way.</p>
<p>'Sona' means 'happy', and as an adjective it is modified to agree with its noun. As a member of the <em>third declension</em>, 'sona' undergoes no change to its <em>ending</em>, but it does pick up a séimhiú (h) when it's paired with a <em>feminine</em> noun.</p>
<p>'Duit' is a prepositional pronoun, which in this case means</p>
<blockquote>
<p>duit = do + tú = to + you = to you</p>
</blockquote>
<p>the 'to' of 'do' is in the proposition sense (don't try to use it to form infinitives of verbs, or anything like that)<a href="#2">[2]</a>.</p>
<p>So we really have</p>
<blockquote>
<p>XY sona duit -&gt; happy XY (masc) to you<br>
XX shona duit -&gt; happy XX (fem) to you</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now for the first part. This is where things go wrong for me.</p>
<p>'Lá' means 'day'. It is masculine.<br>
'Féile' means 'feast'. It is feminine.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.tearma.ie/Search.aspx?term=l%C3%A1+f%C3%A9ile">Tearma.ie</a> seems to think that one makes 'feast day' with 'lá féile', which seems to agree with my grammar book. In the compound noun, 'féile' <em>should</em> go into the tuiseal ginideach (genitive case). As a <em>fourth declension</em> noun, this means it undergoes <em>no change</em>. The resultant word ('feast day') is <em>masculine</em> (the gender is taken from the first noun), so we'll follow it up with 'sona'.</p>
<p><em>However</em>, <a href="http://www.tearma.ie/Search.aspx?term=L%C3%A1+Fh%C3%A9ile+P%C3%A1draig">tearma.ie</a> also says St. Patrick's day is 'Lá F<strong>h</strong>éile Pádraig', so something is going on here. Is the presence of the 'Pádraig' complicating the issue?</p>
<p>The answer that I've found for this is: <strong>yes</strong>. My grammar book is silent on the topic of this slightly-advanced compound noun case. According to <a href="http://nualeargais.ie/gnag/subst2.htm#genitivverwend">Nua Leargais</a>, when two genitives come together (as we would naïvely try for 'féile' and 'Pádraig' after 'lá'), we encounter the <em>functional genitive</em>. In this case:</p>
<ol>
<li>The first word is in the 'functional genitive', and its form is that of a <em>lenited</em>, nominative form. So this gives us 'f<strong>h</strong>éile', even though the <em>genitive</em> of 'féile' is 'féile', as I mentioned before.</li>
<li>The second word is in the genitive. The question is then...</li>
</ol>
<p><em>What the hell is the genitive of Pádraig?</em></p>
<p>The answer seems to be 'it depends'. Situations like this are why I end up feeling like 'Phádraig' and 'Pádraig' are equally valid and get confused. It seems like:</p>
<p><em>In general</em>, the genitive of 'Pádraig' is 'P<strong>h</strong>ádraig' (so 'Patrick's house' is 'teach Phádraig'). This is supported by <a href="http://www.tearma.ie/Search.aspx?term=Pádraig">tearma.ie</a>. However, in special cases it <em>doesn't change</em>, and those cases include 'after féile' and 'after naomh'<a href="#3">[3]</a>.</p>
<p>So to summarise, if you want to say 'Happy St. Patrick's Day' in Irish, and be (probably) grammatically correct about it, it's:</p>
<h2>Lá Fhéile Pádraig sona duit!</h2>
<p>And now you know.</p>
<hr>
<p><a name="1">[1]</a> This turned out to be sufficient to get an A1 in the exam (somehow), but I'll never feel capable of <em>teaching</em> anyone the language if I can't explain why things are how they are.</p>
<p><a name="2">[2]</a> We learned the prepositional pronouns using songs and hand gestures in school, so they're indelibly seared in my memory. Here's the full list of the 'do' ones:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>dom = to me<br>
duit = to you<br>
dó = to him/it<br>
di = to her/it<br>
dúinn = to us<br>
daoibh = to you (plural)<br>
dóibh = to them</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And <a href="http://www.irishpage.com/quiz/preppron.htm">here's a page</a> with some more. You might notice that 'do' means 'to/for' there, which is true, but that is beyond the scope of this post.</p>
<p><a name="3">[3]</a> 'Naomh' means 'saint', so if you, like me, went to a school named after St. Patrick and grew up hearing 'Naomh Pádraig' all the time, you might be forgiven in thinking that's its genitive form.</p>
