<p>The Korean alphabet (Hangul) is - so far - my favourite writing system. It is logical and efficient. It pleases my sense of style. Since starting this post over a month ago I took up learning Mandarin so my feelings towards Hanzi are liable to threaten Hangul's dominance in the future, but for now I side with space-robot alphabet. Because that's what Hangul is.</p>
<p><img src="../images/nuclearlaunch.png" alt="See? Space Robots" class="center"></p>
<p>At first glance one may assume that Hangul consists of logograms - characters representing words rather than phonemes, but this is not the case. The alphabet is very much phonetic. Each "block" is a single syllable, so for example Hangul(한글) is Han(한)+gul(글).</p>
<p>Since syllables are made of phonemes, it is not surprising that the blocks consist of sub-components representing these phonemes. (It was surprising the first time I learned of this, because such an elegant solution to written language had not occurred to me - though upon further reflection, the trick is just "writing words more compactly" so it's not as novel as it is aesthetically pleasing.) Some insane person wrote a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangul_consonant_and_vowel_tables">Wikipedia page</a> documenting every possible syllabic block in Korean, so all you need to do is memorise all ten thousand of these (give or take a few thousand) and reading Korean will become trivial. End of post. If this idea is appealing to you, I might suggest going to Cambridge to do Part III of the Mathematical Tripos.</p>
<p>The more elegant solution is to learn the alphabet. Each letter is called a "jamo", but they only occur inside blocks, sort of like quarks. Unlike quarks, we can still look at them individually. I'll include the <a href="http://web.uvic.ca/ling/resources/ipa/charts/IPAlab/IPAlab.htm">IPA</a> in [], and a 'translation' of IPA into my accent (mileage may vary). For pronunciation purposes, text is no replacement for audio, so I would suggest finding some videos, like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdiR-6e1h0o">this one</a>, for example.</p>
<h3>Simple vowels:</h3>
<p>Simple vowels are made of horizontal or vertical lines and short strokes.</p>
<p>ㅣ [<strong>i</strong>] ("ee" in "tree")<br>
ㅏ [<strong>a</strong>] ("a" in "mad")<br>
ㅓ [<strong>ʌ</strong>] ("u" in "mud")  </p>
<p>ㅡ [<strong>ɯ</strong>] (somewhere between the "oo" in "cool" and the "eu" in "eugh" - I have a really hard time differentiating this from ㅜ)<br>
ㅗ [<strong>o</strong>] ("o" in "bowl")<br>
ㅜ [<strong>u</strong>] ("oo" in "too")  </p>
<h3>Complex vowels:</h3>
<p>Combinations of simple vowels (including diphthongs). I'm not going to include all combinations because many of them are self-evident given the simple vowels.</p>
<p>These ones are less obvious:</p>
<p>ㅐ [<strong>ɛ</strong>] ("e" in "bed")<br>
ㅔ [<strong>e</strong>] ("e" in "grey")  </p>
<p>Generally, ㅗ or ㅜ combined with another vowel gives a "w-" sound, so for example ㅘ is "wah", ㅙ is "weh", and ㅟ is "wee".</p>
<p>There's no letter for "y" in Korean, so if you want to "y" up a vowel, double up on short strokes (I believe this process is called <em>'iotation'</em>. You can do something similar in Slavic languages with ь - Cyrillic comes a close second in the space-robot race.) You get:</p>
<p>ㅑ [<strong>ja</strong>] ("yah")<br>
ㅕ [<strong>jʌ</strong>] ("yuh")<br>
ㅛ [<strong>jo</strong>] ("yoh")<br>
ㅠ [<strong>ju</strong>] ("yoo")  </p>
<p>We can extend this to the complex vowels, to get ㅒ for "yeh" and ㅖ for a slightly different "yeh".</p>
<h3>Consonants:</h3>
<p>Syllables are usually a consonant-vowel sandwich, so consonants can be "initial", "medial", or "final" (I'll write [<strong>i/m/f</strong>]), and the placement makes a (small) difference to the pronunciation of the letter.</p>
<p>ㄱ [<strong>k/g/k̚</strong>] ("k" as in "Kant", "g" as in "gravity", "k̚" as in "quark")<br>
ㄴ [<strong>n/n/n</strong>] ("n" as in "neutron")<br>
ㄷ [<strong>t/d/t̚</strong>] ("t" as in "tachyon", "d" as in "down", "t̚" as in "cat")<br>
ㅅ [<strong>s/s/t̚</strong>] ("s" as in "strange")<br>
ㅁ [<strong>m/m/m</strong>] ("m" as in "mass")<br>
ㅂ [<strong>p/b/p̚</strong>] ("p" as in "point", "b" as in "baryon", "p̚" as in "top")<br>
ㅇ [<strong>-/ŋ/ŋ</strong>] (This is just a silent placeholder in the initial position. In all others it's "ng", as in "ping")<br>
ㄹ [<strong>ɾ/ɾ/l</strong>] ("ɾ" as in "alveolar tap", a sound which is neither "r" nor "l")  </p>
<p>Some consonants are obtained from others by <em>aspiration</em>. Aspiration is basically just adding air to the sound - so imagine trying to sneak a "h-" sound in after the consonant. In Hangul, the addition of a horizontal line seems to denote this aspiration, or a general 'softening' or alteration of the sound (in the case of the letter I like to think of as "j"). This produces:</p>
<p>ㄱ &gt; ㅋ [<strong>kʰ/kʰ/k̚</strong>] ("kʰ" is an aspirated "k", oddly enough)<br>
ㄷ &gt; ㅌ [<strong>tʰ/tʰ/t̚</strong>]<br>
ㅅ &gt; ㅈ [<strong>tɕ/dʑ/t̚</strong>] ("tɕ" as in "charm", "dʑ" as in "jam")<br>
ㅈ &gt; ㅊ [<strong>tɕʰ/tɕʰ/t̚</strong>] ("tɕʰ" as in "oh god send help")<br>
ㅂ &gt; ㅍ [<strong>pʰ/pʰ/p̚</strong>] ("pʰ" as in <em>strangling noises</em>)<br>
ㅇ &gt; ㅎ [<strong>h/ɦ/-</strong>] ("h" as in "hello", "ɦ" as in "cool whip")</p>
<h3>Doubled letters:</h3>
<p>There are also "double letters":<br>
ㄲ, ㄸ, ㅃ, ㅆ, ㅉ<br>
... which are "tense", so they're pronounced a bit like you're after spending the last hour reading articles about phonetics and just realised it's too late to watch Breaking Bad. "Damn it!" ~ "땀읻!"</p>
<p>I should stress that this entire post has very little to do with the Korean language. I don't know any Korean, but transliteration can be fun, and this article was largely about IPA. Trying to cram English into a foreign language really makes you appreciate phonetic differences.</p>
