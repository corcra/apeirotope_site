    <div class="entry-content">
        <p>Here's what happened:</p>
<p>My phone started acting up. The lock button turned into a 'maybe turn the phone off' button. The unlock button turned into a 'maybe turn the phone off, <em>or</em> open the camera?' button. I impulse-purchased a new phone, and the old one magically fixed itself. New phone went into a box and my SIM remained micro-sized for a little longer.</p>
<p>I moved to Switzerland, got a nano SIM, started dual-wielding phones. New phone for new SIM, old phone for everything else. I migrated my apps to new phone (this was surprisingly tricky and there's an entire story in there about me conveniently being in the USA to receive a single text message, but it's a tangent), so I got a new Signal fingerprint. (Then my old phone bricked itself, as they do.)</p>
<p>I went to put my new Signal fingerprint on my lovely SSLy Github-pages website and noticed it was broken. For how long this was the case I don't know. I think it was a Jekyll update? Who knows. The time had come. I'd been thinking of leaving gh-pages for a while, so this was a good excuse.</p>
<p>Reasons for wanting to leave:</p>
<ul>
<li>using plugins with Jekyll and gh-pages is mildly painful</li>
<li>the solution, and/or Jekyll itself was <em>increasingly frustratingly slow</em></li>
<li>gh-pages was too mysterious</li>
</ul>
<p>and the new reason:</p>
<ul>
<li>website was mysteriously broken</li>
</ul>
<p>These are probably fixable, I am sure. Maybe my solution isn't the best, but it's mine. I decided to: <strong>move from Jekyll to <a href="link to pelican">Pelican</a></strong> and <strong>host my site myself</strong>. By the time you're reading this, I'll have achieved that second part. At the time I'm writing it, I haven't even started.</p>
<p>Why did I do this?</p>
<ul>
<li>Jekyll uses Ruby, Pelican uses Python, I know Python a <em>lot</em> better than Ruby</li>
<li>I never knew Jekyll very well, so there were no temptingly sunk costs to care about</li>
<li>I saw a site using Pelican during an impressionable moment</li>
<li>self-hosting (in a VPS, let's not be unreasonable) affords a level of control that I apparently want</li>
</ul>
<p>So, this site now looks <em>rather different</em>. That's because another thing happened: I realised that I'm not a front-end web developer, or designer, or basically a person who has touched HTML since she was making Pok√©mon fansites as a ten-year-old. But I'd also like my site to look good. The old version, [which I should screenshot for posterity] was my first adventure into CSS and was unsurprisingly minimalist. I got some compliments on the design of it (yay!) but it was very hand-crafted and it looked it. </p>
<p>Now I am balancing competing desires: a site which <strong>looks good</strong> (and works well), and a site which is <strong>my creation</strong>. The solution for now is to use an existing Pelican theme, made by someone who presumably knows a lot more about websiting than I do, and modify it to my own purposes. Apparently the one I picked was intended to look like <a href="...">Medium</a> so now after several hours of mucking around I have a Medium blog with no features. Excellent. </p>
<p>I'm modifying the theme (see <a href="https://github.com/corcra/medius">my fork</a>) and I will continue to do so until I get distracted by <a href="http://www.internationalphoneticalphabet.org/ipa-sounds/ipa-chart-with-sounds/">something else</a>.</p>
